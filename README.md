# When the Forecast Fails: CitiBike Demand Forecasting in the Era of Sudden Disruptions
## Project C4
### Reimo Zukker, Erik Reinart, Alan Erik Kasuk

CitiBike is a large bike-sharing system whose daily usage varies due to many external factors such as weather, seasonality, weekdays, and
longer-term trends. These fluctuations directly affect operational planning: bicycle redistribution, staff allocation, maintenance scheduling, and
overall service availability. To plan resources effectively, the organization needs a clearer understanding of what influences daily ridership.

## The goal of the project:
- Understanding how weather conditions and time-related factors affect daily ridership count 
- Building a data-driven model that could predict daily ridership trends based on weather and time-related variables
