# **When the Forecast Fails: CitiBike Demand Forecasting in the Era of Sudden Disruptions**
### **Project C4**  
**Authors:** Reimo Zukker, Erik Reinart, Alan Erik Kasuk  

CitiBike is a large bike-sharing system whose daily usage varies due to several external factors such as weather, seasonality, weekdays, and longer-term behavioral trends. These fluctuations directly affect operational planning: bicycle redistribution, staff scheduling, maintenance, and overall service availability.  
To plan resources effectively, the organization needs a clear understanding of what drives daily ridership—and how predictable those patterns remain during sudden disruptions.

---

## **Goal of the Project**
- Understand how weather conditions and calendar effects influence daily ridership.  
- Build data-driven forecasting models (Prophet, Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict daily ridership.  
- Evaluate how these models behave under real-world shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
