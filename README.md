# When the Forecast Fails: CitiBike Demand Forecasting in the Era of Sudden Disruptions
## Project C4
### Reimo Zukker, Erik Reinart, Alan Erik Kasuk

CitiBike is a large bike-sharing system whose daily usage varies due to many external factors such as weather, seasonality, weekdays, and
longer-term trends. These fluctuations directly affect operational planning: bicycle redistribution, staff allocation, maintenance scheduling, and
overall service availability. To plan resources effectively, the organization needs a clearer understanding of what influences daily ridership.

## The goal of the project:
- Understanding how weather conditions and time-related factors affect daily ridership count 
- Building a data-driven model that could predict daily ridership trends based on weather and time-related variables

## How to replicate analysis
Download/Clone cleaned data:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C6lJWK8ttg8n7tYnzmK8YjthXxf8U6ip?usp=sharing

When you have access to cleaned data folder, you can download any of the notebooks in modelling folder. 
Check for any path variables in notebooks and replace them with your path to downloaded clean data.

Now you should be able to run notebook cells and replicate plots and model outputs.
